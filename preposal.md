# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Raspberry Pi Temperature Montior:
- Detect temperature and use LEDs to indicate temperature level
- Blue for cold, green for normal, red for high/hot

Guitar Tuner:
- Capture audio input
- Let user choose what string they would like to tune
- Tell user to tune down or up based on input frequency

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am doing this project solo.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I do not have any questions as of now.
